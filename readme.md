# Numpy Katas

`numpy-katas` is a growing collection of machine learning and probabilistic models and algorithms
written exclusively in `NumPy` and the Python `standard library`.

The purpose of the project is to provide reference implementations of common
machine learning components for sharping your ML skills and cracking interviews.
